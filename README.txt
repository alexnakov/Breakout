This is Option 2 -> Breakout

Status of the project: 

Complete: the interviewer may review this as my work.
The 'main' branch is the branch the interview should review and discuss with me in my 
upcoming interview.

I will create another branch called 'Additional Fixtures' where I will attempt to optimise 
some of the code and look for possible improvement to be made in the logic.
If I do make significant improvements, I will discuss them briefly in my upcoming interview.

To run the code:
1. copy the code and Assets from the main branch
2. ensure pygame is installed 
3. run the main.py file using python 3
