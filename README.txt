This is Option 2 -> Breakout

Status of the project: 

Complete, the interviewer may review this as my work.
I will no longer make changes to my code. 

I have made huge improvements in the last 24 hours so I decided it is suitable to merge branches.

To run the code:
1. copy the code and Assets from the main branch
2. ensure pygame is installed 
3. run the main.py file using python 3

Thanks for taking the time to review my code.
